    "The original way of counting, once the obvious limits of counting on fingers was reached, was using *tally marks* or notches on a stick, stone, or piece of clay as symbols each representing a single thing.\n",
    "These were added to together to create a *number*, which symbolizes a quantity of things.\n",
    "Though this was less limited than using fingers, these marks likewise reached a limit as numbers increased.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Roman approach to this was to use symbols or *numerals* to count groups, then these numerals were added together to get numbers.\n",

    "\n",
    "Positional number systems use fewer numerals than additive number systems, \n",

    "The Hindu number system uses the numerals 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. \n",
    "We inherited the number system from the Arabic cultures, and the number system uses Hindu-Arabic numerals or what we call Arabic numerals.\n",
    "The number system is called *decimal* because it uses 10 different numerals, each of which we call *digits*.\n",
