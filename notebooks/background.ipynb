    "# Computers\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers are suited to solve problems can be abstracted to be represented mathematically by *data*, such as measures, counts, facts, or labels, provided a method can be created to sove problems using that data.\n",
    "*Programs* encode methods to solve problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers process data exceptionally faster and more accurately than humans.\n",
    "\n",
    "Certain problems are especially appropriate to solve using computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Finance \n",
    "\n",
    "Financial problems are are based on money, which is a mathematical abstraction of wealth.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trillions of dollars of financial transactions occur each year with hardly a shred of paper exchanged.\n",
    "Much of the world's wealth exists only in computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Insurance largely involves statistical representations of risk.\n",
    "Accident data, lifespan measures based on health, and property loss are analyzed to estimate appropriate insurance costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Income and cost of living estimates are used to measure economic health.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Communications\n",
    "\n",
    "Phone, image, and Internet data are transferred constantly.\n",
    "Computers store and route information between destinations.\n",
    "Data communications has transformed life.\n",

    "# Python\n",
    "Python is a programming language that simplifies writing programs.\n",
    "Python allows organizing data to make writing programs easier and writing instructions to process that data.\n",
    "It has several advantages over other programming languages.\n",
    "- It is easier to learn than most programming languages.\n",
    "- It is a widespread language, available on almost all types of computers.\n",
    "- It has wide support for many common problems, and resources to learn how to solve them.\n",
    "- It is easier to run and to develop programs than many languages.\n",

    "You must understand various mathematical concepts to program.\n",
    "These sections include some programming specific information you may not have seen,\n",
