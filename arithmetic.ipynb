    "## Operations on numbers\n",
    "Kotlin allows the expected basic operations on numbers: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, and Negation.\n",
    "Kotlin also supports the Modulo operation which gives the remainder of a division, after one number is divided by another. \n",
    "These operations use slightly different symbols in a program, for example because multiplying using `x` can be confused with the letter x, and trying to multiply using '$\\cdot$' is impossible because that is not a keyboard symbol. \n",
    "For example, `8 % 3` is 2 as shown here.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"Basic-math-modulo.png\" width=\"200\" height=\"200\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations have specific priorities for the order in which operations are applied. \n",
    "Negation has the highest priority, then multiplication, division, and modulo have the next priority, then addition and subtraction are the lowest.\n",
    "Parentheses, `(` and `)`, are used to change the operation order. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|Operation |Symbol |Program |Priority |\n",
    "|:- |:- |:- |:- |\n",
    "|Negation |`-` |`-` |highest |\n",
    "|Multiplication |`x` or $\\cdot$ |* |next highest | \n",
    "|Division |$\\div$ |`/` |next highest | \n",
    "|Modulo |`%` |* |next highest | \n",
    "|Addition |`+` |`+` |lowest |\n",
    "|Subtraction |`-` |`-` |lowest |\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations of the same priority are applied left to right, so the order of operations for `3 + 6 - 2` is `(3 + 6) - 2`.\n",
    "For operations of different priorities, in programs it might sometimes be clearer and less error prone to use parentheses even if they not necessary, so `5 + 8 / 4 - 2` might be written as `5 + (8 / 4) - 2`. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"Exponents\"></a>\n",
    "## Exponents\n",
    "Exponents are a way to represent repeated multiplication of the same number with fewer symbols. \n",
    "If a number is multiplied several times, the number of times it is multiplied can be represented with an *exponent*.\n",
    "For example, multiplying 2 three times can be represented using an exponent of 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "$2 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2 = 2^3 = 8 $\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that $2^3$ is \"two raised to the power 3\".\n",
    "The value 2 is the *base* of the exponent.\n",
    "We can then do arithmetic on numbers with exponents.\n",
    "We notice that is the same as \n",
    "\n",
    "$(2 \\cdot 2) \\cdot 2 = 2^2 \\cdot 2^1 = 2^3$  \n",
    "\n",
    "where $2^1$ is 2 \"multiplied once\".  \n",
    "\n",
    "We notice a pattern that\n",
    "\n",
    "$2^2 \\cdot 2^1 = 2^3 = 2^{2 + 1}$\n",
    "\n",
    "so that when numbers with exponents are multiplied together, the exponents add.\n",
    "There is one interesting result from this.\n",
    "We can create a number with an exponent of 0, $2^0$, or \"two multiplied 0 times\", where it is not obvious what that means.\n",
    "When we multiply that number by another number with an exponent we get\n",
    "\n",
    "$2^1 \\cdot 2^0 = 2^{1 + 0} = 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "What value is $2^0$? The only way to get that result is\n",
    "\n",
    "$2^1 \\cdot 1 = 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore $2^0$ must be 1.\n",
    "That fact will be used in the Hindu number system below.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a reverse of exponents called *logarithms*. \n",
    "If we say a number *N* has the value of a base *B* with an exponent *m*\n",
    " \n",
    "$N = B^m$\n",
    "\n",
    "we say that exponent m is the logarithm of N, base B\n",
    "\n",
    "${log N}_B = m$\n",
    "\n",
    "Logarithms are another convenient way to represent large numbers.\n",
